All the algorithms from basic to advance present of will be uploaded in this repo.


## Algorithms
1. Linear Search: A simple searching algorithm that checks each element in a list or array until a match is found.

2. Binary Search: A more efficient searching algorithm applicable to sorted lists. It repeatedly divides the search space in half until the target element is found.

3. Depth-First Search (DFS): A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

4. Breadth-First Search (BFS): Another graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, visiting vertices at the same level before moving to the next level.

5. Jump Search: An optimization over linear search for sorted arrays. It jumps ahead by a fixed number of steps and then performs linear search in the reduced range.

6. Interpolation Search: An improved version of binary search that works better for uniformly distributed sorted arrays, using interpolation to estimate the position of the target element.

7. Hashing: A technique that uses a hash function to map keys to array indices, providing efficient retrieval of data.

8. A* Search Algorithm: A heuristic-based algorithm commonly used in pathfinding and graph traversal, aiming to find the shortest path between two points.

9. Exponential Search: A technique that involves two steps - first, finding a range where the target element may exist, and then performing binary search within that range.

10. Fibonacci Search: A search algorithm that divides the array into Fibonacci numbers to determine the search range, similar to binary search.
